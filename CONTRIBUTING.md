# Contributing to the Project

We welcome contributions from everyone. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

## Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or a test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Submitting Changes

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
- Make your changes.
- Ensure that your code adheres to the existing code conventions and test coverage.
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
- Create a new Pull Request.

Thank you for your contributions!
