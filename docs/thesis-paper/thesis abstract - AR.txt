Optimizing Building Facades for Cooling Using Wind Direction and Strength


https://github.com/ronmaccms/macadThesis24


This research aims to design and optimize building facades to enhance cooling efficiency by leveraging data on wind direction and strength. The study will utilize AI-driven simulations, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), to create adaptive facade designs that respond to environmental conditions, reducing energy consumption and improving indoor comfort.
The objective is to address the critical need for energy-efficient buildings by optimizing building facades to improve cooling efficiency. Traditional passive cooling strategies, such as natural ventilation, shading, and thermal mass, often fall short in dynamically adapting to changing environmental conditions. This research proposes the development of adaptive facade systems that can respond in real-time to variations in wind direction and strength.
Optimizing building facades for cooling has significant environmental and economic benefits. By reducing reliance on mechanical cooling systems, these adaptive facades can lower greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to more sustainable building practices. Economically, the reduced energy consumption translates to lower operating costs, making buildings more cost-effective over their lifecycle.
This research will develop a comprehensive web-based platform that integrates GIS data with advanced simulations. The platform will provide architects, urban planners, and other stakeholders with accessible geospatial data, facilitating more efficient and informed architectural planning and development. AI-driven simulations, particularly using PINNs, will be employed to design adaptive facades that can adjust in real-time to environmental conditions, enhancing cooling efficiency and indoor comfort.
We aim to support the design of building facades by integrating advanced AI-driven simulations and environmental data. The resulting facades will enhance cooling efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and improve indoor comfort, contributing to the development of more sustainable and cost-effective buildings in the AEC industry.
