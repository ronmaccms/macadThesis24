<h2>About The Project</h2>

<p>This project was developed as part of the IAAC: AI 2023-24 course, focusing on creating an open-source, web-based platform to simulate urban wind flow using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The simulation utilizes real-time and historical data, integrating models with neural network computations to visualize pedestrian comfort and promote sustainable urban planning.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collect and preprocess data from various sources, including NOAA, OpenWeatherMap, and OpenStreetMap.</li>
  <li>Develop and train a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model using NVIDIA Modulus and PyTorch to simulate wind flow.</li>
  <li>Integrate the trained model into a Vue.js application for real-time interaction and visualization of results.</li>
  <li>Provide insights into enhancing pedestrian comfort and sustainable urban design by utilizing data-driven simulations.</li>
  <li>Foster a collaborative and open-source approach, inviting community contributions to enhance the platform's capabilities.</li>
</ul>
